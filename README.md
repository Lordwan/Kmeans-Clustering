# Kmeans-Clustering
In this task i was given a .csv file with data containing information of all the countries of the world's birthrate over thier life expectansy.
I was tasked to manipilate this data and draw a Kmeans clustering chart which has 6 centroids points.
I was then tasked to print out all the countries which falls into every centroid group respectively.
I was also tasked to use the euclidean distance to calculate the respective clusters.
All this information is printed out and displayed using pandas and matplotlib.
Numpy and sklearn are used for the math.
